1. The program outputs an error because new_line is not declared.

2. as an int: it prints an integer just fine and code works
   as a double: it runs but doesn't show something readable
   as a string: doesn't run, error appears saying it doesn't work

3. 

What happens if you use a function without a result as part of an expression, like new_line() + 7?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void new_line() 
 {
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
new_line() + 7
    return 0;
}

What happens is that the program runs into problems with void and int since it can do that expression because it's invalid.

What happens if you call a function and you don’t do anything with the result (i.e. you don’t assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression)?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(6, 7);
    cout << "The sum is: " << sum << endl;
    add(6, 7);
    cout << "We called add(6, 7) but did nothing with it" << endl;
    return 0;
}
